# C&C Red Alert 2: Research
After not even having this game cross my mind in 10 years, I once again found it, and decided to just start messing around with it when I have nothing else to do.
I'll sometimes just upload new features and interesting things I find in the game.

This was the best game of its time. Period.

### Getting Started
Simply compile the solution with Visual Studio (or your choice of compiler.)

### Feature List
* List all ingame configurations processed (now to folders, not a single file.)
* Modify, at runtime, aforementioned game configurations
* In skirmish mode, disable the AI's ability to build anything.
* Infinite money
